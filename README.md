Here is my [personal website](https://caohaiwen.github.io/).

## How to get started:
- Click the “fork” button in the top right.
- Rename the repository “[your GitHub username].github.io”, which will also be your website’s URL.
- Set site-wide configuration
  - The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in '_config.yml', which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site’s github repository. 
  - The configuration file for the top menu is in '_data/navigation.yml.' For example, if you don’t have a 'blog posts', you can remove those items from that 'navigation.yml' file to remove them from the header.
- Create content: there are several markdown files stored in directories _pages.
  - about.md       : it corresponds to the content shown in homepage;
  - publications.md: it corresponds to the content shown in Publications page;
  - teaching.md:     it corresponds to the content shown in Teaching page;
  - experiences.md:  it corresponds to the content shown in Experiences page.
- Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/xxxx.pdf.
- Check status by going to the repository settings, in the “GitHub pages” section.
